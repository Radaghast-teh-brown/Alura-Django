# Alura-Django
This is my initial experience with Django framework.

## Structure of the Webpage

Django website split the project into apps that perfom specific functions. This framework uses Model-View-Crontoller. This patter works following this steps

1. The controller receive a request from the user.

2. The Model organize all the data and send it to the view

3. Render the information to the user.
